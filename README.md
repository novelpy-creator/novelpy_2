# PyGame Novel 2.0 (NovelPy Reimagined)
This released is for joke and but also show the new look of the game. First, text box it's used rect rather than image. Girl folder is removed. But you can get in the old releases. (From now is archived.)

# How to use ?
These are some idea:

    - Using source code.

    - Download zip-based installer. (source code)
    
    - Download executable version. (play the game only.)

# Updated.

Now we're in reloaded. There's are some features:

    - `non_config/` folder (no config.py and defining game files in game.py)
    
    - `config/` folder (Excute string by reading config.py)
